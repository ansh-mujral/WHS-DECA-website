                     <p>Since DECA is a CTSO, the CA Department of Education requires all students to take a CTE course in order to be a member of DECA Inc. The CTE courses provided at Washington High School are Web Design, Marketing, Personal Finance, and Business Ownership. If a student cannot take a CTE course, the student can become a member of WHS DECA but cannot attend conferences like NorCal, States, and ICDC. The club will organize conferences like MiniCon for these members.</p>

DECompetitors are members who are enrolled in a CTE course and as a result will have the opportunity to attend the 3 main conferences: NorCal CDC, States CDC, and International CDC.</p>
