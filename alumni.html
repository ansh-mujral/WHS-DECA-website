"My high school DECA experience impacted the rest of my life as it led me to study business in college. Through role plays and written events, my presentation skills improved and i was set up for further success in case competetions in college. My deca leadership experience, both on the chapter and state level, led me to new friends from all over the country. These are friends that i still talk to and meet up with today (a decade later). When Mr. Wu asked me to come back to the conferences and help him chaperone and judge events, I was so excited. Giving back to the organization that gave me so much brings me joy."</strong> </h4>
